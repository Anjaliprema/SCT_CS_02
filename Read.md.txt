1.Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images. Certainly! Below is a simple Python script using the Pillow library for image processing. Make sure to install Pillow first if you haven't already: pip install pillow This script uses a simple encryption and decryption process. You can customize this method or explore other pixel manipulation techniques for more robust encryption.
2.Both functions take the image path and a key as arguments. They open the image, iterate through each pixel, and apply a simple XOR operation with the key to encrypt or decrypt the pixel values. The encrypted and decrypted images are saved with appropriate filenames.
